# About
This is the repository to record and track the recitation & project of what I have done in ECE550: Fundamental of Computer Systems and Engineering.

# Menu
The repository is divided into two sections: recitation and project checkpoints
## Recitation

#### Recitation 1 - README link [here](Recitation1/README.md)

Brief: design a NAND gate using Structural Verilog and test the code using testbench and waveform.

#### Recitation 2 - README link [here](Recitation2/README.md)

Brief: build a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) in Verilog and test your adder using waveforms and testbenches.

#### Recitation 3 - README link [here](Recitation3/README.md)

Brief: learn Wallace Tree Multiplier (WTM), build your own 5x5 WTM and test our WTM using testbench.

#### Recitation 4 - README link [here](Recitation4/README.md)

Brief: learn how to use moore design and mealy design and implement the modulo-5 counter in behavioural verilog.

#### Recitation 5 - README link [here](Recitation5/README.md)

Brief: learn more about designing the ALU functionalities using behavioral verilog instead of structural verilog.

#### Recitation 6 - README link [here](Recitation6/README.md)

Brief: learn how to load your design on reconfigurable hardware (i.e., the FPGA chip on our DE2 board) and run it on it.

#### Recitation 7 - README link [here](Recitation7/README.md)

Brief: learn about PS2 interfaces and controllers, and alter the code so that pressing a key on a PS2 keyboard causes the FPGA board to display the corresponding character on the built-in LCD screen.

#### Recitation 8 - README link [here](Recitation8/README.md)

Brief: learn about VGA interfaces and controllers, practice loading .mif files into their project directory, and alter the code so that the slide switches on the FPGA will be used to control the memory location holding the information for an image to be displayed

## Project checkpoint

#### Project checkpoint 1 - README link [here](Project1/README.md)

Brief: first checkpoint is to design and simulate an ALU using Verilog that support for addition, subtraction and overflow detection.

#### Project checkpoint 2 - README link [here](Project2/README.md)

Brief: second checkpoint is to improve the design of the previously designed ALU to support more functionality, including bitwise AND and bitwise OR, Logical Left Shift and Arithmetic Right Shift.

#### Project checkpoint 3 - README link [here](Project3/README.md)

Brief: third checkpoint is to design and simulate a register file, including 2 read ports, one write ports and 32 registers.

#### Project checkpoint 4 - README link [here](Project4/README.md)

Brief: fourth checkpoint is to design and implement part of single cycle CPU, and implement some instructions including `add`, `addi`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `sll`, `sra` 

#### Project checkpoint 5 - README link [here](Project5/README.md)
Brief: fifth checkpoint is to design and finish the remaining part of single cycle CPU, and implement `j` type instructions including `j`, `bne`, `jal`, `jr`, `blt`, `bex` and `setx`
