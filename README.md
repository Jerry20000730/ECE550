# About [Currently in Progress]
This is the repository to record and track the recitation & project of what I have done in ECE550: Fundamental of Computer Systems and Engineering.

# Menu
The repository is divided into two sections: recitation and project checkpoints
## Recitation

#### Recitation 1 - README link [here](Recitation1/README.md)

Brief: design a NAND gate using Structural Verilog and test the code using testbench and waveform.

#### Recitation 2 - README link [here](Recitation2/README.md)

Brief: build a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) in Verilog and test your adder using waveforms and testbenches.

#### Recitation 3 - README link [here](Recitation3/README.md)

Brief: learn Wallace Tree Multiplier (WTM), build your own 5x5 WTM and test our WTM using testbench.

#### Recitation 4 - README link [here](Recitation4/README.md)

Brief: learn how to use moore design and mealy design and implement the modulo-5 counter in behavioural verilog.

#### Recitation 5 - README link [here](Recitation5/README.md)

Brief: learn more about designing the ALU functionalities using behavioral verilog instead of structural verilog.

## Project checkpoint

#### Project checkpoint 1 - README link [here](Project1/README.md)

Brief: first checkpoint is to design and simulate an ALU using Verilog that support for addition, subtraction and overflow detection.

#### Project checkpoint 2 - README link [here](Project2/README.md)

Brief: second checkpoint is to improve the design of the previously designed ALU to support more functionality, including bitwise AND and bitwise OR, Logical Left Shift and Arithmetic Right Shift.

#### Project checkpoint 3 - README line [here](Project3/README.md)

Brief: third checkpoint is to design and simulate a register file, including 2 read ports, one write ports and 32 registers.
