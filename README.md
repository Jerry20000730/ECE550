# About [Currently in Progress]
This is the repository to record and track the recitation & project of what I have done in ECE550: Fundamental of Computer Systems and Engineering.

# Menu
The repository is divided into two sections: recitation and project checkpoints
## Recitation

#### Recitation 1 - README link [here](Recitation1/README.md)

Brief: design a NAND gate using Structural Verilog and test the code using testbench and waveform.

#### Recitation 2 - README link [here](Recitation2/README.md)

Brief: build a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) in Verilog and test your adder using waveforms and testbenches

#### Recitation 3 - README link [here](Recitation3/README.md)

Brief: learn Wallace Tree Multiplier (WTM), build your own 5x5 WTM and test our WTM using testbench

## Project checkpoint

#### Project 1 checkpoint - README link [here](Project1/README.md)

Brief: first checkpoint for our processor is to design and simulate an ALU using Verilog that support for addition, subtraction and overflow detection.
